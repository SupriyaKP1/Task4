# Task 4
##Objective
To understand how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected by analyzing hashing
algorithms, password cracking techniques, and modern authentication mechanisms.

##Tools Used
* Hashcat
* John the Ripper
* Online Hash Identifiers (Free)
* Free online cybersecurity documentation and tutorials

##Concepts Covered
* Password storage mechanisms (hashing vs encryption)
* Common hash types (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, bcrypt)
* Password cracking techniques
* Brute force vs dictionary attacks
* Weak password analysis
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

##Practical Analysis Performed
* Studied how passwords are securely stored using hashing
* Identified different hash formats
* Analyzed how weak hashes can be cracked using wordlists
* Compared brute force and dictionary attack methods
* Evaluated reasons why weak passwords fail
* Studied the importance of MFA in modern authentication systems

##Deliverables
* Password Security Analysis Report (PDF)
* README.md explaining the task

##What I Learned
* Why passwords should be hashed instead of encrypted
* How attackers crack weak passwords
* Why bcrypt is more secure than MD5 and SHA-1
* How MFA protects accounts even if passwords are compromised
* Best practices for strong authentication

##Task Submission Guidelines – Compliance
* Self-research was performed using free online resources
* No paid tools or services were used
* Errors and doubts were resolved through self-debugging
* A separate GitHub repository was created for this task
* All task-related files are included in this repository

##Outcome
Gained strong foundational knowledge of password attacks, defenses,
and secure authentication practices essential for cybersecurity roles.
